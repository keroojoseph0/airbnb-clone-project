## üß© Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that together replicate the essential functionality of a modern booking platform. Each feature is designed to reflect real-world software development patterns and promote scalability, security, and maintainability.

1. User Management

Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication and authorization are handled using JWT tokens or Django‚Äôs built-in system to protect user data and manage access roles (e.g., guest, host, admin).

2. Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes key details such as location, price, availability, and description. This feature ensures hosts can manage their listings easily while maintaining accurate and up-to-date information for guests.

3. Booking System

Facilitates the reservation process between guests and property owners. Users can check availability, make bookings for specific dates, and view booking history. The system prevents overlapping reservations to maintain reliability.

4. Review and Rating System

Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings after completing their stay. This feedback helps improve transparency, trust, and user engagement within the platform, allowing future guests to make informed booking decisions.

5. Payment Integration

Handles secure payment processing for confirmed bookings. This includes tracking payment status, transaction amounts, and payment methods. It ensures all transactions are processed safely and efficiently.

6. Search and Filter

Provides advanced search capabilities that allow users to filter properties by location, price range, amenities, and ratings. This improves user experience by helping guests find the most suitable accommodations quickly.

7. Admin Dashboard (Optional)

Gives administrators tools to monitor users, properties, bookings, and payments. It includes data insights and moderation features to ensure smooth platform operation and compliance with system rules.

## üîí API Security

Security is a fundamental aspect of the Airbnb Clone Project, ensuring that sensitive user data, property details, and financial transactions are protected at all times. The following key security measures will be implemented to safeguard the platform‚Äôs integrity and maintain user trust.

1. Authentication

Implementation: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or Django‚Äôs authentication system will be used to verify user identities and control access to the API.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access protected resources, preventing unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information.

2. Authorization

Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied to define permissions for different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin).

Why It‚Äôs Important: Authorization restricts users from performing actions beyond their privileges ‚Äî for example, a guest cannot delete another host‚Äôs property listing.

3. Data Encryption

Implementation: All communication between the client and server will occur over HTTPS (SSL/TLS), and sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed using bcrypt or Django‚Äôs built-in encryption mechanisms.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Encryption protects user credentials, personal information, and financial details from being intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

4. Rate Limiting

Implementation: API rate limiting will be configured to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a certain time frame.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Rate limiting prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and abuse of the API, ensuring stable and reliable performance for all users.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization

Implementation: The backend will validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other input-based vulnerabilities.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Input validation ensures the system only processes safe and expected data, protecting against data corruption and malicious exploitation.

6. Secure Payment Handling

Implementation: Payment data will be processed through trusted third-party payment gateways, and no sensitive card details will be stored on the server.

Why It‚Äôs Important: This ensures compliance with PCI DSS standards and protects users from financial fraud and identity theft.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code.

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically integrates and tests new code changes to detect errors early.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Ensures that tested and approved code is automatically deployed to the production environment with minimal manual effort.

Why It‚Äôs Important for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is essential for maintaining a high-quality and reliable codebase in the Airbnb Clone Project.
It helps the team to:

- Detect and fix bugs early through automated testing.

- Deploy updates faster and more consistently.

- Reduce human error during deployment.

- Improve collaboration among developers by maintaining a smooth workflow.
